# CS-350: Emerging System Architectures & Technologies 
### Thermostat Project
**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
- This project involved creating a thermostat system to automate temperature control and report its state via UART, solving the problem of automated heating regulation and remote monitoring.

**What did you do particularly well?**
- I managed the task scheduling efficiently, ensuring responsive button handling, temperature reading, and data transmission without blocking the system.

**Where could you improve?**
- I could improve on peripheral configuration, particularly with I2C, by spending more time on thorough initial setup and testing edge cases.

**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**
- I'm adding technical documentation to aid with future embedded projects.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?**
- Task scheduling, peripheral integration (GPIO, UART, I2C), and embedded C programming will be transferable to other embedded system projects.

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
- I used modular design, clean coding practices, and non-blocking task scheduling to make the system easy to maintain, read, and extend for future modifications.
